title: About
---
I am Jan Schiefer, German mad scientist (Dipl.-Ing., actually), working in 
Seattle as a researcher for a major technology company. No, it's not 
Microsoft.

I am interested in modern user interfaces, functional programming, non-traditional 
computing architectures, and any places these things intersect. 

Also, pugs.
